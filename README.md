# Cuber: A Web-Based Puzzle Adventure

# Project Overview:

For my Cuber Game Platform project, I aimed to create an engaging web-based game using Unity WebGL for development and ASP.NET MVC for the backend. I defined clear objectives, designed the system architecture, and developed both the game and the accompanying website. Key tasks included creating the game mechanics in Unity, implementing secure user registration and login functionality through ASP.NET MVC, and integrating a SQL database to manage user data. I also prioritized performance optimization to reduce load times and ensure smooth gameplay across various devices. 

I chose .NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) for web development because of its clear separation of concerns, which enhanced maintainability and testability. Its flexible routing allowed for clean, SEO-friendly URLs, and the robust tooling support from Visual Studio—including a local MySQL database option—streamlined my development and testing processes. The strong community and extensive resources provided invaluable support, while built-in security features helped ensure application safety. Additionally, .NET MVC integrated seamlessly with modern front-end frameworks and was scalable for projects of any size. 

Building the game in Unity proved to be an excellent decision due to its cross-platform capabilities, enabling me to create games for PC, consoles, and mobile devices with minimal adjustments. The user-friendly interface simplified the development process, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced developers like myself. The rich Asset Store offered a vast library of ready-made components, saving time and enhancing my creativity. With Unity’s strong community support, I found troubleshooting easier and continually learned new techniques. Its powerful graphics rendering and optimization tools ensured high-quality visuals and smooth performance, while C# scripting allowed for robust programming. Additionally, Unity accommodated various game genres and provided built-in analytics and monetization tools to help track player engagement and optimize revenue strategies, making it an ideal platform for my project. Hosting the game on itch.io further enhanced my efforts, as it offered a user-friendly platform for sharing and monetizing my creation, along with flexible pricing options and access to a vibrant community of gamers and developers that provided valuable exposure and feedback. 

To ensure a high-quality user experience, I emphasized rigorous testing, including cross-browser compatibility and user acceptance testing. I implemented security measures like encrypted password storage and secure session management to protect user data. The platform was initially hosted locally, with plans to make it public in the future. Ultimately, my goal was to deliver a seamless, secure, and engaging experience for players.
