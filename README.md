# SeniorProject

This project aims to develop a web-based game platform using Unity WebGL for the game development and ASP.NET MVC for the backend. The game, titled "Cuber," will feature a puzzle-based gameplay experience, hosted on a website with user registration and login functionality. The backend, powered by ASP.NET MVC and a SQL database, will manage user data, including player sessions, registration, and login information, while providing a secure environment for data management. The frontend will be served to users via a responsive and interactive interface.
