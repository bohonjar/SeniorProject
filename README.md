# SeniorProject - Cuber

This project aims to develop a web-based game platform using Unity WebGL for the game development and ASP.NET MVC for the backend. The game, titled "Cuber," will feature a puzzle-based gameplay experience, hosted on a website with user registration and login functionality. The backend, powered by ASP.NET MVC and a SQL database, will manage user data, including player sessions, registration, and login information, while providing a secure environment for data management. The frontend will be served to users via a responsive and interactive interface. Below is the general flow chart of how this application will function.

Published on itch.io, the game is seamlessly integrated into my personal website via an embedded iframe. Users can log in or register to track their progress and enjoy the game.

Features include:

Multiple Levels: Navigate through progressively challenging levels.
Dynamic Gameplay: Algorithms for block and color randomization keep the game fresh and exciting.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration functionality.
Progress Tracking: Registered users can save their progress and achievements.

Technologies used include:

Game Development: Unity, C#
Web Development: ASP.NET MVC, C#
Database: SQL Server for user authentication and progress tracking
Deployment: Published on itch.io, embedded in a personal website
